fix: default to "main" schema when scanning all MongoDB databases

When attaching MongoDB without specifying a database name, the extension
now defaults to the "main" schema (following DuckDB convention), similar
to how the Postgres extension defaults to "public". Previously, it would
default to the first non-system schema found.

Changes:
- Set default_schema to "main" in constructor when database_name is empty
- Create "main" schema entry when scanning all databases
- Trigger ScanSchemas from LookupSchema if schemas haven't been scanned yet
- Update tests to verify default schema behavior and information_schema queries
- Add entity mapping and default schema documentation to README
- Condense README text while preserving diagrams
- Remove debug logging statements

This ensures consistent behavior with DuckDB conventions and fixes the
USE command when attaching without a specific database name.
